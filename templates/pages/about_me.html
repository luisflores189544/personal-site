            Iâ€™m a self-taught programmer and I have been programming 
            in Python since 2013.  
        </p>
        <p>
            I started learning SQL/T-SQL in 2011 prior to discovering Python.
        </p>
        <p>
            I became interested in SQL after observing a C# developer 
            at a previous job writing a SQL query.  I thought SQL was 
            so cool at that point in time.
        </p>
        <p>
            I went home that day and starting Googling the crap out of 
            MS SQL.
        </p>
        <p>
            After a few days of some intense studying, I asked him if I could help 
            work an invertory report that was a deliverable.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since that day I have been working with or as part of 
            an IT department.  I have a strong desire to expand my technical skills, specifically
            my Python knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            After learning SQL/Python, I began working with desktop frameworks, including Qt. 
            I also created a script to do some webscrapting.  My skills have evolved into 
            integrating processes and applications via API's and scripting ETL processes.
        </p>
        <p class="c-paragraphs">
            My focus now is Web development.  In the last 3 years I began 
            learning JavaScript, CSS3, HTML5; the fundamentals of Web development. The 
            frameworks that I have began to learn are Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails, JQuery and Vue.js.
